 <h6>**hdzero ez font guide**<h6>
 **I was having trouble adding fonts to my hdzero goggles so i decided to make a guide for dummys like myself.**

 <h4>1</h4> Download the font you want from [The hd-zero github](https://github.com/hd-zero/hdzero-osd-font-library) or make your own
 <h4>2</h4> Rename the .bmp file to BTFL_000.bmp
 <h4>3</h4> Make sure (this is what got me, thanks cat) you are not double naming the file BTFL_000.bmp.bmp in windows you may have to turn on **"show file extensions"** to be sure. if the font isnt working try leaving the file named BTFL_000 with no .bmp
 <h4>4</h4> format your sd card **in the goggles** 
 <h4>5</h4> put the sd card in your computer and create a folder named "resource" inside of that folder create another one named "OSD" and inside of that create another one called "FC"
 <h4>6</h4> drag or copy/paste your BTFL_000 file into the "FC" folder on your sd card.
 <h4>7</h4> enjoy your new font and fly safe.
