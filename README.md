 <h6>hdzero ez font guide<h6>
 I was having trouble adding fonts to my hdzero goggles so i decided to make a guide for dummys like myself.

 <h2>1</h2> Download the font you want from [The hd-zero github](https://github.com/hd-zero/hdzero-osd-font-library) or make your own
 <h2>2</h2> Rename the .bmp file to BTFL_000.bmp
 <h2>3</h2> Make sure (this is what got me, thanks cat) you are not double naming the file BTFL_000.bmp.bmp in windows you may have to turn on **show file extensions** to be sure. if the font isnt working try leaving the file named BTFL_000 with no .bmp
 <h2>4</h2> format your sd card in the goggles
 <h2>5</h2> put the sd card in your computer and create a folder named "resource" inside of that folder create another one named "OSD" and inside of that create another one called "FC"
 <h2>6</h2> drag or copy/paste your BTFL_000 file into the "FC" folder on your sd card.
 <h2>7</h2> enjoy your new font and fly safe.
