# **HDZero EZ betaflight Font Guide**

I was having trouble adding fonts to my HDZero goggles, so I decided to create a guide for dummies like myself.

**1.** Download the font you want from [The HD-Zero GitHub](https://github.com/hd-zero/hdzero-osd-font-library/tree/main/BTFL) to download just click on the file you want, click "view raw" then right click and save image as. 

**2.** Rename the `.bmp` file you just downloaded to **BTFL_000.bmp**.

**3.** Make sure (this is what got me, thanks cat) you are not double-naming the file **BTFL_000.bmp.bmp**. In Windows, you may have to turn on **show file extensions** to be sure. If the font isn't working, try leaving the file named **BTFL_000** with no `.bmp`.

**4.** Format your SD card in the goggles.

**5.** Put the SD card in your computer and create a folder named **"resource"**. Inside that folder, create another one named **"OSD"**, and inside that, create another one called **"FC"**. I'm not sure if Capital Letters matter but i do it this way and it works.

**6.** Drag or copy/paste your **BTFL_000** file into the **"FC"** folder on your SD card.

**7.** Enjoy your new font and fly safe.
